# obsdelay
Simple lua script to set the delay/sync on an OBS source.

To use, simply:

1. Change the value of `source_name` to the name of the OBS source you want the delay set on.
2. Change the value of `delay` to however many ms you want the delay
3. Load the script into OBS
4. In OBS settings, set the Hotkey you'd like to trigger the script to set the delay

For my use, I created 2 copies with different hotkeys, one to set the delay, and one to unset it.
